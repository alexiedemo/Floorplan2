# 🚀 iOS App Setup Instructions

Your iOS app has been generated successfully! Follow these steps to get it running in Xcode.

## 📱 Quick Start

1. **Open in Xcode**: Double-click the `.swift` files or create a new iOS project and replace the default files
2. **Set Deployment Target**: iOS 15.0+ (recommended)
3. **Choose Device**: iPhone simulator or physical device
4. **Build & Run**: Press ⌘+R or click the ▶️ button

## ⚙️ Xcode Configuration

### Modern Info.plist Setup (Recommended)
Instead of a separate Info.plist file, modern Xcode projects use **"Generate Info.plist File"**:

1. Select your **project** in Xcode navigator
2. Select your **app target**
3. Go to **Build Settings** tab
4. Search for **"Generate Info.plist File"**
5. Set it to **YES** (this is usually the default)

### Bundle Identifier
Set your bundle identifier in **Build Settings → Product Bundle Identifier**:
- Example: `com.yourname.createuseiphone`

## 🚀 Setting up Codemagic CI/CD

To automate builds, tests, and deployments, you can use Codemagic. Here's how:

1. **Create a Codemagic Account**: Sign up at [Codemagic](https://codemagic.io).
2. **Connect Repository**: Connect your Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to Codemagic.
3. **Add `codemagic.yaml`**: Place the `codemagic.yaml` file (provided below) in the root of your repository.
4. **Configure Code Signing**:
   - In the Codemagic UI, go to **Settings** > **Code signing identities**.
   - Upload your iOS distribution certificate (`.p12` file) and set its password.  Reference this in `codemagic.yaml` as `CM_CERTIFICATE`.
   - Import your provisioning profile. Reference this in `codemagic.yaml` as `CM_PROVISIONING_PROFILE`.
5. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - In the Codemagic UI, go to **Settings** > **Environment variables**.
   - Add `YOUR_TEAM_ID` with your Apple Developer Team ID as the value.
6. **Start Build**: Trigger a new build in Codemagic.
